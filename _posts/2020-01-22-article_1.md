# Plotting  Boxplot/Violinplot using Python

<em>In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to plot boxplots in python, from simple to more advanced boxplots.
I added violin plots as a bonus.</em>

One of the first things we do with new data is to explore the distribution of the data and its statistics. A boxplot is a visual representation of the distribution of the data based on the fundamental "five-number summary" statistics. The five-number statistical summary reports the minimum, the 25th percentile, the 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile and the maximum. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles are commonly referred to as the first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2) and third quartile (Q3), respectively.
