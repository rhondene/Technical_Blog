# Plotting  Boxplot/Violinplot using Python

<em>In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to plot boxplots in python, from simple to more advanced boxplots.
I added violin plots as a bonus.</em>

One of the first things we do with new data is to explore the distribution of the data and its statistics. A boxplot is a visual representation of the distribution of the data based on the fundamental "five-number summary" statistics. The five-number statistical summary reports the minimum, the 25th percentile, the 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile and the maximum. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles are commonly referred to as the first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2) and third quartile (Q3), respectively.

Plotting boxplots  is a quick way to visually learn about about your new data such it skewdness, the symmetry and spread (variance) of the data points.

[The complete jupyter notebook with code and notes is found <a href="https://github.com/rhondene/data_science_ML_lessons_biology/blob/master/Plotting_boxplots.ipynb">here</a>]

To make the boxplot I will use the pandas and seaborn libraries in python to show the relationship between a categorical feature ( or factor) and a numeric feature.

The data is my own dataset that categorises the organization of certain genes - whether it is nested in another gene or not- and the nucleotide composition of each type of gene.

<h3>One numeric to one category plot</h3>
Make a simple boxplot with <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html">seaborn.boxplot</a> that shows the distribution of A-content for only the "Non-Nested" genes.

<h3>One numeric to many categories plot</h3>
Next, we'll compare the distribution of the A-content for both categories of genes.

<h3><strong>Many Numeric to Many Categories</strong></h3>
Recall that the dataset stores four different nucleotide content for each type gene. What if we want to visualise the distributions for all nucleotides for all categories of genes? Given that At first I tried the pandas.boxplot groupby method, and got this output:

<img class="  wp-image-71 aligncenter" src="https://rhondenewint.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/groubpy.jpg" alt="groubpy" width="617" height="69" />

<img class="  wp-image-69 aligncenter" src="https://rhondenewint.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/box2.png" alt="box2" width="368" height="384" />

This layout is not visually convenient for comparison. Ideally, I want to see all the nucleotide compositions for all categories of genes on the same axis. However, each nucleotide content is stored in separate columns, and unfortunately we cannot pass multiple columns to the seaborn or pandas boxplot functions. In other words, the current structure of the data is not amenable to this kind of analysis.

However, I found a work-around using <strong>pandas.melt()</strong> function.

Pandas.melt() reshapes the data such that all the measurements for  the nucleotides  are in the same column, and a separate column, "var_name", is created to keep track of which measurement corresponds to each nucleotide.

Bingo! Now all the nucleotide measurements are in one column!

Now it's time to plot a comprehensive boxplot with all the information in one place by plotting the <em>Organization</em> column against the <em>value </em> and colour each box by the nucleotide.<img class="  wp-image-67 aligncenter" src="https://rhondenewint.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/4.jpg" alt="4" width="656" height="188" />

<h3>Violinplots</h3>
You easily can re-use the same code to make violinplots simply replacing "seaborn.boxplot" with "seaborn.violinplot".

<img class="  wp-image-77 aligncenter" src="https://rhondenewint.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/viol1.jpg" alt="viol1" width="640" height="178" />

Violinplots carries all the information that boxplots have, but are more informative because the shape of the violin changes with the density of the data.

The thicker region of the violins represents data points with higher frequency, while the thicker regions represents low-frequency data points. For example, most Non-Nested genes have an C-content of 0.25.

Here is a great <a href="https://blog.bioturing.com/2018/05/16/5-reasons-you-should-use-a-violin-graph/">post</a> that explains in more detail about the benefits of violinplots and how to interpret them.

I hope this posts helps.
