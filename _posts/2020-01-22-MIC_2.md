# Maximal Information Coefficient pt.2: Comparison of MIC to Pearson's, Spearman's,and Cosine Similarity


<em>In this article, I compare MIC with other popular association metrics on simulated data with and without noise using python.</em>

In my previous <a href="https://rhondenewint.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/maximal-information-coefficient-a-modern-approach-for-finding-associations-in-large-data-sets"> article , </a>I discussed the maximal information coefficient, a relatively new method for detecting relationships in data sets. I found a python package called minepy, so I decided to compare MIC's performance with other widely used measures of association on simulated data with examples of linear and non-linear relationships.

The Jupyter notebook with the full code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rhondene/data_science_ML_lessons_biology/blob/master/max_info_corr_comparison.ipynb">here</a>.  In conclusion, while the performance on the linear data was the same across the board, MIC outperformed Pearson's R, Spearman's Rank and Cosine similarity on detecting non-linear relationships.

Below are snippets from the notebook.

<h3>Performance on a Sinusoidal relationship</h3>
<em>For example, the concentration of a cell cycle protein versus time.</em>
